Configuration files for Docker, Proxmox and others

# Important note
I am using [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) as a reverse proxy, you can find all the configuration files needed in docker-compose/traefik.
Please note that I am using it in combination with Cloudflare DNS. If you have another DNS provider please edit the config accordingly.
